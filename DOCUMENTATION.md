## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: Vue.js 3 with Composition API
**Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom utilities
**Component Pattern**: Single File Components (SFC) with modular architecture

#### Vue.js 3 Patterns Used

**Composition API**: All components use the modern Composition API for better code organization and reusability:

```javascript
setup(props, { emit }) {
    const { ref, reactive, computed, onMounted } = Vue;
    // Reactive state management
    // Event handlers
    // Lifecycle hooks
    return { /* exposed properties */ };
}
```

**Reactive State Management**:
- `ref()` for primitive reactive values
- `reactive()` for object state
- `computed()` for derived values
- Prop validation and type checking

**Event Communication**: Parent-child communication through props and emit events:
- Props down: Data flows from parent to child components
- Events up: Child components emit events to notify parents of changes

**Component Composition**: Each component is self-contained with its own:
- State management
- Event handlers
- Computed properties
- Template rendering logic

### Backend Architecture

**API Server**: json-server providing RESTful endpoints
**Data Storage**: JSON database with relational data structure
**Route Mapping**: Custom route configuration for API endpoint organization

#### REST API Design

The API follows RESTful conventions:
- `GET /api/tasks` - Retrieve all tasks
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create new task
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id` - Update existing task
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Delete task

## Conclusion

This coordination document establishes the complete framework for the TaskFlow Pro SWARM development process. All agents must adhere to:

1. **Phase sequencing** - No phase advancement without quality gate approval
2. **Architecture constraints** - CDN-only, no build tools, ever
3. **Communication protocols** - Structured status reporting and escalation
4. **Quality standards** - Code quality, testing, and documentation requirements
5. **Success criteria** - Clear validation against PRD requirements

**SPARC Orchestrator Agent** is responsible for enforcing all aspects of this coordination framework and has final authority on all phase advancements and production release approval.

# Product Requirements Document: Task Search Feature

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Business Context
TaskFlow Pro users manage multiple projects with dozens of tasks across different statuses and priorities. As the task list grows, users struggle to find specific tasks quickly, leading to frustration and reduced productivity. Users need an efficient way to narrow down their task view based on various criteria without having to manually scan through long lists.

### 1.2 Purpose
This document defines the requirements for a search and filtering system that enables users to quickly locate and organize tasks within TaskFlow Pro. The feature will provide text-based search combined with filtering by task attributes and flexible sorting capabilities.

### 1.3 Goals
- Reduce time spent looking for specific tasks
- Enable users to focus on relevant subsets of tasks
- Support multiple workflows (status-based, priority-based, project-based)
- Provide immediate visual feedback on search and filter actions
- Maintain simplicity and ease of use

## 2. User Personas

### Primary Persona: Project Manager
- Manages 3-5 active projects simultaneously
- Needs to quickly review high-priority tasks across all projects

**FR-1: Search Input**
- Provide a text input field for entering search queries
- Search should be case-insensitive
- Search should match partial text within task titles and descriptions
- Results should update in real-time as the user types

**FR-2: Search Scope**
- Search must look in task title field
- Search must look in task description field
- A task matches if the query appears in either field (OR logic)

### 5.2 Filters

**FR-3: Status Filter**
- Provide a way to filter by task status
- Options: All, To Do, In Progress, Completed
- Default: All (show all statuses)
- Single selection only

- Options: All, Low, Medium, High
- Default: All (show all priorities)
- Single selection only

**FR-5: Project Filter**
- Provide a way to filter by project
- Options: All, plus a list of all available projects
- Default: All (show all projects)
- Single selection only
- Project list should be dynamic based on available data

**FR-6: Combined Filter Behavior**
- When multiple filters are active, they combine using AND logic
- Example: Status=In Progress AND Priority=High shows only high-priority in-progress tasks
- Search query also combines with filters using AND logic

### 5.3 Sorting

**FR-7: Sort Options**
- Users must be able to sort by:
  - Task title (alphabetical)
  - Priority level (low to high)
  - Due date (earliest to latest)
- Default sort: Due date ascending

**FR-8: Sort Direction**
- Each sort field should support both ascending and descending order
- User should be able to toggle between ascending and descending
- Visual indicator should show current sort direction

**FR-9: Sort Behavior with Missing Data**
- Tasks without a due date should appear at the end when sorting by due date
- Priority sorting should order: Low → Medium → High (ascending)
- Title sorting should be case-insensitive

### 5.4 Results Display

**FR-10: Task Count**
- Display the total number of tasks matching current search/filter criteria
- Update count in real-time as filters change
- Include indicator when filters are active (e.g., "12 tasks (filtered)")

**FR-11: Statistics Cards**

- Show counts for: Total, To Do, In Progress, Completed
- Statistics should reflect the currently filtered set, not all tasks

**FR-12: Empty State**
- When no tasks match the criteria, show an appropriate message
- If filters are active: Suggest clearing or adjusting filters
- If no tasks exist at all: Suggest creating the first task
- Provide relevant action button (Clear Filters or Create Task)

### 5.5 Filter Management

**FR-13: Clear Filters Action**
- Provide a "Clear Filters" button or action
- Button should only be visible when at least one filter is active
- Clicking should reset all filters to their default values
- Clearing filters should not affect sort field or sort direction

**FR-14: Filter State**
- Filter selections should persist while the user remains on the page
- Filter state should reset when the page is reloaded or navigated away from

## 6. User Interface Requirements

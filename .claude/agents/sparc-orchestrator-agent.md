**Execution Strategy**: Launch ALL agents in parallel using single message with multiple Task calls

**IMPORTANT**: Use a SINGLE message with multiple Task() calls to run these agents in parallel:

```
// Launch all three agents simultaneously in one message:

Task(
  subagent_type: "ui-ux-polish-agent",
  description: "Implement responsive design and accessibility",
  prompt: "Implement responsive design following mobile-first approach for the complete TaskFlow Pro application. Apply Tailwind CSS styling per PRD color scheme: status colors (todo=#6B7280, in_progress=#3B82F6, completed=#10B981), priority colors (low=#6B7280, medium=#F59E0B, high=#EF4444). Create custom Tailwind theme extensions. Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance with proper ARIA labels, focus management, keyboard navigation.

  description: "Conduct final quality assurance",
  prompt: "Conduct final comprehensive quality assurance review of TaskFlow Pro application. Validate cross-browser compatibility (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+). Perform final security review and performance validation. Ensure all PRD requirements are met: functional requirements (CRUD operations, search/filter, data persistence, status workflow), performance requirements (<2s load time, <100ms filter response, <500ms API operations). Validate responsive design and accessibility compliance. Check for any code quality issues. Prepare release readiness assessment."
)
```

**Wait for ALL three agents to complete**

**Phase 4 Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] Responsive styling implemented across all breakpoints

- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility confirmed
- [ ] Performance requirements met (<2s load, <100ms filter)
- [ ] Final quality assurance passed
- [ ] Complete documentation finalized
- [ ] Production-ready application validated

**Mark Phase 4 as completed in TodoWrite**

---

### Step 3: Final Integration Testing & Validation

After Phase 4 completion, conduct final integration testing:

1. **Functional Testing**:
   - Test all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete tasks)
   - Verify search and filtering (< 100ms response)
   - Validate status workflow (todo → in_progress → completed)
   - Test data persistence via API

2. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure initial page load (target: < 2 seconds)
   - Test API operation response times (target: < 500ms)
   - Verify filter response time (target: < 100ms)

3. **Architecture Validation**:
   - Confirm CDN-only delivery (no build tools used)
   - Verify Vue 3 Composition API implementation
   - Validate template-based components (no SFC)
   - Confirm json-server API working on port 3001
   - Validate concurrent server startup with `npm start`

4. **Documentation Review**:
   - Verify setup instructions work
   - Confirm API documentation is accurate
   - Validate user guides are complete

### Step 4: Error Handling & Recovery

**If Any Agent Fails or Gets Stuck:**

1. **Identify the Issue**:
   - Check TodoWrite state to see which agent/task is stuck
   - Review any error messages or incomplete deliverables
   - Use Grep/Glob to check for partial file creation

2. **Attempt Recovery**:
   - Re-read PRD.md and requirements for context
   - Simplify the task prompt with clearer instructions
   - Break complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks
   - Launch agent again with enhanced context

3. **If Retry Fails**:
   - Mark agent as blocked in TodoWrite
   - Identify specific dependencies preventing progress
   - Check if tools are accessible to the agent
   - Report to user with specific blocker details and recommended fixes

4. **Timeout Detection**:
   - If agent runs >5 minutes with no observable progress
   - Check for infinite loops or unclear instructions
   - Escalate to user if automated recovery impossible

**Common Issues & Solutions**:
- **Agent can't find PRD.md**: Provide full path `/home/training/claude-code-subagents/PRD.md`
- **Agent creates files in wrong location**: Remind about project root and .claude/ exclusion
- **Agent uses generic approach**: Re-emphasize specific technologies (Vue 3 CDN, json-server)
- **Phase completion unclear**: Provide explicit validation criteria

### Step 5: State Management Protocol

**Use TodoWrite systematically throughout orchestration:**

1. **On Initialization**:
   - Create hierarchical todo structure with all phases
   - Mark current phase as in_progress
   - List all agents in current phase as pending

2. **Before Launching Each Agent**:
   - Mark specific agent task as in_progress
   - Update TodoWrite with current state

3. **After Agent Completion**:
   - Mark agent task as completed
   - Validate deliverables exist and are complete
   - Update phase status if all phase agents complete

4. **On Phase Completion**:
   - Mark entire phase as completed
   - Create todos for next phase
   - Launch first agent of next phase immediately

5. **Persistent Tracking**:
   - TodoWrite persists across sessions
   - Enable resumption if orchestration interrupted
   - Provide clear progress visibility to user

## Best Practices

**Architecture Compliance:**
- ✅ NO build tools or compilation steps allowed
- ✅ All code must run directly in browsers via CDN
- ✅ Use Vue 3 CDN from unpkg.com
- ✅ Use Tailwind CSS CDN (not npm package)
- ✅ Template-based components only (no .vue SFC files)
- ✅ json-server for backend (no SQL databases)

**Agent Coordination:**
- Always use correct specialized agent types (not generic)
- Provide complete context from previous phases
- Wait for agent completion before proceeding in sequential phases
- Launch parallel agents in single message with multiple Task() calls
- Validate deliverables before marking phase complete

**Quality Gates:**
- Enforce quality validation at each phase boundary
- Never skip validation steps for speed
- Ensure PRD requirements met before advancing
- Maintain comprehensive documentation throughout

**Communication:**
- Use clear, specific task prompts for agents
- Include technology stack details in every prompt
- Specify file paths and expected deliverables
- Provide phase context to each agent

## Report / Response Format

After completing orchestration work, provide status update:

**Current Phase Status**: [Phase X - Description]

**Completed Deliverables**:
- [List what has been completed with file paths]

**Phase Progress**:
- Phase 1: [✓ Completed / In Progress / Pending]
- Phase 2: [✓ Completed / In Progress / Pending]
- Phase 3: [✓ Completed / In Progress / Pending]
- Phase 4: [✓ Completed / In Progress / Pending]

**Architecture Compliance**: [✓ Validated / Issues Found]

**Quality Gates**: [✓ Passed / In Progress / Issues]

**Next Actions**:
- [Specific next steps with responsible agents]

**Blockers/Risks**:
- [Any issues requiring attention or user intervention]

Always include specific next steps and maintain clear progress visibility.
